.. _trip-delete-label:

Delete Trip
^^^^^^^^^^^

This API endpoint should be used if you want to ignore an existing trip and all its data from future API responses and driver score computations. Once deleted a trip has no impact on the driver's scores any more and hence deletion will lead to change in driver scores.

Note that a trip MUST already exist in Zendrive system for it to be successfully deleted (if a trip and its data is not yet uploaded to server it cannot be deleted). This API endpoint typically should be called after existence of trip is verified by a GET call or after a Webhook callback has been invoked.

.. sourcecode:: bash
